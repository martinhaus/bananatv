== Description ==

This plugin lets you add the custom post templates in your Wordpress custom post type. You can easily apply your custom post template in custom post type single page like page template.
 
The templates are defined similarly to page templates, and will replace single.php for the specified post.

Admin can select multiple custom post type where they want to apply custom post template.(i.e. you can choose a template which is not single.php).  

Easily managed through the admin area.

Admin can use default setting for the custom post type plugin by simply clicking on default setting button.

First note: Page templates use "Template Name:", whereas custom post templates use "WP Post Template:".

Second note: You must have the custom post template files in your theme in the same directory/folder as your index.php template file, not in a sub-directory/sub-folder.
